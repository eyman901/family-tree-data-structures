# Family Tree Management System (C++)

This project was developed as a **final project for the Data Structures course (3rd Semester)**.

It is a **menu-driven Family Tree Management System** implemented in **C++**, focusing on core data structure concepts such as structures, pointers, and recursion.

 Project Description:
The Family Tree Management System allows users to create and manage family relationships in a hierarchical structure.  
The system supports adding individuals, defining relationships, and validating family rules.

This project was designed to strengthen understanding of **tree-like data structures** and **pointer-based relationships**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add persons with basic details (name, age, gender)
- Define relationships:
  - Parent – Child
  - Siblings
  - Spouse
- Display family tree using **recursive traversal**
- Edit existing person data
- Validate and prevent illegal relationships, such as:
  - Parent–child marriage
  - Sibling marriage
  - Ancestor/descendant marriage
  - Minor–adult marriage
  - Inbreeding cases

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Structures (`struct`)
- Pointers
- Arrays
- Recursion
- Tree-based data representation
- Menu-driven programming

 How to Run the Project
1. Open the `.cpp` file in **Dev-C++** or any C++ compiler
2. Compile the program
3. Run and interact using the menu options
